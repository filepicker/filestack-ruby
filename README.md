Ruby SDK for Filestack API and content management system.
</p>

**Important: This is the readme for 2.1.0.**
A recent change (2.1.0) has renamed the `Client` to `FilestackClient`, and the `Filelink` to `FilestackFilelink`. Please make neccessary changes before upgrading to newest release if you run 2.0.1 or 2.0.0. This was to address namespace concerns by users with models and attributes named `Client`, and to be more consistent.

## Overview

* A multi-part uploader powered on the backend by the [Filestack CIN](https://www.filestack.com/products/content-ingestion-network).
* An interface to the [Filestack Processing Engine](https://www.filestack.com/docs/image-transformations) for transforming assets via URLs.
* The Filestack Picker - an upload widget for the web that integrates over a dozen cloud providers and provides pre-upload image editing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'filestack'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install filestack

## Usage

### Import
```ruby
require 'filestack'
```
Intialize the client using your API key, and security if you are using it.
```ruby
client = FilestackClient.new('YOUR_API_KEY', security: security_object)
```
### Uploading
Filestack uses multipart uploading by default, which is faster for larger files. This can be turned off by passing in ```multipart: false```. Multipart is disabled when uploading external URLs.
```ruby
filelink = client.upload(filepath: '/path/to/file')

# OR

filelink = client.upload(external_url: 'http://someurl.com')
```

### Security
If security is enabled on your account, or if you are using certain actions that require security (delete, overwrite and certain transformations), you will need to create a security object and pass it into the client on instantiation.

```ruby
security = FilestackSecurity.new('YOUR_APP_SECRET', options: {call: %w[read store pick]})
client = FilestackClient.new('YOUR_API_KEY', security: security)
```

### Using FilestackFilelinks
FilestackFilelink objects are representation of a file handle. You can download, get raw file content, delete and overwrite file handles directly. Security is required for overwrite and delete methods.

### Transformations
Transforms can be initiated one of two ways. The first, by calling ```transform``` on a filelink:

```ruby
transform = filelink.transform
```

Or by using an external URL via the client:

```ruby
transform = client.transform_external('https://someurl.com')
```

Transformations can be chained together as you please.

```ruby
transform = filelink.transform.resize(width: 100, height: 100).flip.enhance
```

You can retrieve the URL of a transform object:

```ruby
transform.url
```

Or you can store (upload) the transformation as a new filelink:

```ruby
new_filelink = transform.store
```

For a list of valid transformations, please see [here](https://www.filestack.com/docs/image-transformations).

### Tagging

If you have auto-tagging enabled onto your account, it can be called on any filelink object (tags don't work on external URLs).

```ruby
tags = filelink.tags
```

This will return a hash with labels and their associated confidence:

```ruby
{
    "auto" => {
        "art"=>73,
        "big cats"=>79,
        "carnivoran"=>80,
        "cartoon"=>93,
        "cat like mammal"=>92,
        "fauna"=>86, "mammal"=>92,
        "small to medium sized cats"=>89,
        "tiger"=>92,
        "vertebrate"=>90},
    "user" => nil
}
```

SFW is called the same way, but returns a boolean value (true == safe-for-work, false == not-safe-for-work).

```ruby
sfw = filelink.sfw
```
